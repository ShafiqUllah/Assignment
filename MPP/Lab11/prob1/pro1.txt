    a. List<Number> nums = ints;  This causes compiler error as List<Integer>
       can't be converted into List<Number>;.

    b. nums.add(3.14);  This causes compiler error as extending Generics can't be used
       to assign values as the compiler can't determine the type of 3.14 when added to nums.
       It could be any class that is a subclass of Number.
